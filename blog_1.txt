When I think about how to learn, there is a focus on the medium at which the individual is
recieving information from. In the ever increasing technological world we are living in - 
news is converging closer to instantaneous outlet. This is generally a good thing, allowing
for less potential manipulation. But mixing this with the ability for anyone and everyone to 
beam information across the whole globe concurrently gives way to a superflous amount of information.
AI and generative text will only increase these masses making it crucial for one to filter what
they consume. Writing is the opportunity for a person to aggregate, filter, challenge, and change
how all this information affects oneself.

I am beginning this blog to allow myself to think more critically about the events, breakthroughs,
issues, and discussions that are being had everyday. Consecrating my thoughts, feelings, and opinions
as they change throughout the pursuit of truth will help me understand myself better. And hopefully
from there I can apply that self reflection into behavioral changes to improve the relationships I have
with others.

Please allow me this chance to be vunerable, transparent, and naive in times as pursue this path forward.
